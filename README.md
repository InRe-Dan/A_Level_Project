# A_Level_Project
My first programming project, a tile-based dungeon crawler inspired by Crypt of the Necrodancer. 

The game features a level editor with an action stack for undo/redo, lighting using recursion, the A* pathfinding algorithm and and inventory system that allows the player to use various items in combat.

Crucially, it's still missing collision detection and more advanced gameplay mechanics to actually make the game __fun__
